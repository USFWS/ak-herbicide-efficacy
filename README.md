# Alaska Herbicide Efficiency

## Overview

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducts annual surveys to identify the presence of terrestrial non-native plant species within southern Alaska. Herbicides are applied to identified non-native plants in an effort to control the further spread of these species and subsequent surveys are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of herbicide treatment. Scripts included in this repository allow users to run a power analysis to determine the sample size requirement and create randomly selected sample sites within designated polygons where non-native plants have been treated with herbecide.

## Installation

Scripts rely on [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages.

## Usage

Scripts are currently designed for specific data collected in 2023 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Until this workflow is generalized, users should not attempt to apply these scripts to their polygons.
