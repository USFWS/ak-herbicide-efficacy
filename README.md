# Alaska Herbicide Efficiency

## Overview

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducts annual surveys to identify the presence of terrestrial non-native plant species within southern Alaska. Herbicides are applied to identified non-native plants in an effort to control the further spread of these species and subsequent surveys are conducted to evaluate the efficiency of herbicide treatment. Scripts included in this repository allow users to run a power analysis to determine the sample size requirement and create randomly selected sample sites within designated polygons where non-native plants have been treated with herbecide.

## Installation

Scripts rely on [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [sf] (https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages.

## Usage

The scripts were developed to
